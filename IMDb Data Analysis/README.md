IMDb Data Analysis

This project performs data analysis on IMDb movie data using Python with pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn libraries. 
The dataset used contains information about movies, including budget, country, genre, original language, original title, revenue, score, and status.

Description
The analysis includes exploring the distribution of movie scores, identifying the top movie genres, and examining the relationship between movie revenue and budget. 
Visualizations such as histograms, bar charts, and scatter plots are utilized to gain insights into the IMDb dataset.
